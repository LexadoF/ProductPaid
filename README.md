## Data model
### Database (Generated thanks to php my admin designer)
![imagen](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8afd602-3c59-4ea6-a68f-1d6e43e3869e)
- The database contains 4 tables, customers, products, deliveries, transactions
- Table *customers* handle the user data and stores the hashed passwords to allow logins
- Table *products* stores all the products data, like price and stock
- Table *deliveries* stores all the deliveres data, sent by the user when it's doing the payment process
- Table *Transactions* Stores all the payment details as well as referencing the integration with the external payment system and the rest of the tables (it acts like a bridge table)
